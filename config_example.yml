# sample configuration file for bitfloor-ruby
# put your keys in the appropriate spaces bellow
# NOTE! testbed accounts are entirely seperate and will need their own keys!
# rename this file config.yml
# if using different trade programs (such as bitfloor's node.js example) make a new set of keys for each or you might break your nonce.
